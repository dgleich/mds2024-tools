These are the programs, tools, and data we created for SIAM MDS 2024.

Main codes:
- `scheduling-gurobi-final.jl`: This is the code to call Gurobi
- `review-posters-qt5.py`: This was the QT5 review widget to quickly scan through minisymposium submissions.
- `order-poster-sesions.jl`: This is the code to compute the ordering for the poster sessions. 

Data files:


Other codes:

- `mini-embeddings.json`: These are the OpenAI embeddings for the minisymposium text
- `mini-similarity-sinews.jl`: This is the 
- `nlp-weight-explore.jl`: This was a code to play with the minisymposium embedding data
- `match-posters.jl`: The AI tools helped us write this (with some good ideas from Klinvex's codes) to match posters to minisympoisum. 
- `get-schedule.py`: This writes out a Julia program to check things in the schedule. 

We also used Alicia Klinvex's codes... (add URL)

We replaced all emails with hash codes representing their emails. I don't think this causes any problems, but 
didn't have a chance to rerun the scripts.
